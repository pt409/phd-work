based on this paper:

X. W. Zhou, R. A. Johnson, and H. N. G. Wadley, Phys. Rev. B, 69,
144113 (2004).

This tool can be used to create an DYNAMO-formatted EAM
setfl file for alloy systems, using any combination 
of the elements discussed in the paper and listed in
the EAM_code file, namely:

Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pd, Pt, Al, Pb, Fe, Mo, Ta, W, Mg, Co, Ti, Zr

With a potential taken from Xie et al, J. Appl. Phys. D, 47, 22 (2014) for:

Cr

And two potentails fitted by Taylor et al (publication pending):

Re, Ru

Steps:

1) Add any new potentials to be included to the EAM.code file. Order for the parameters is:
   r_e, f_e, \rho_e, \rho_s, \alpha, \beta, A, B, \kappa, \lambda, F_{n0}, F_{n1}, F_{n2}, F_{n3}, F_0, F_1, F_2, F_3, \eta, F_e,
   atomic number, atomic mass, F_3, \beta, \lambda, \rho_n / \rho_e, \rho_o / \rho_e
   You also need to edit the param n in create.f in this case.
2) compile create.f -> a.out  (e.g. gfortran create.f)
3) edit the input file EAM.input to list 2 or more desired elements to include
4) a.out < EAM.input will create an EAM *.set file
5) in DYNAMO or LAMMPS lingo, this is a setfl file
   that can be used with the LAMMPS pair_style eam/alloy command
